I would have wanted to use SASS as the webpack configuration specified supported that file format but node-sass was not added as a dependency which was required to use SASS
I modified the index.html file even if it was outside src to add a nice font.
I could not modify the fill color of the svg icons as they were being imported through URL, and I could only load them using <img> or <object> attribute, which create a shadow DOM with an SVG inside which I cannot select with css. An inline-css-loader for webpack would have fixed that possibly.
I needed to use dangerouslySetInnerHTML even though it causes a warning to be able to render the <br> tags inside the data file.
I needed to add "prop-types" library to get rid of eslint errors so that I could pass the test requirements, given that react.proptypes has been deprecated long time ago.
